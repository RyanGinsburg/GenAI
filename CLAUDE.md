# Project: Cornell Club Matching Agent

## What this is
A chatbot that helps Cornell students find student organizations. The student
chats and/or uploads their resume. The system matches them to relevant clubs
from Cornell's real CampusGroups directory, researches each matched club's
website for deadlines/meetings/coffee chats, shows the student what it found,
and — only after the student approves — adds the relevant events to their
Google Calendar.

## Tech stack (decided, don't change without discussion)
- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- LLM: Anthropic Claude API (claude-sonnet for extraction/reasoning tasks)
- Embeddings: any lightweight embedding model or API is fine — keep it simple,
  store vectors in a local file (numpy array or Chroma), no hosted vector DB
- Frontend: React
- Calendar: Google Calendar API (OAuth2)
- Data: scraped JSON files in /data, not a full database (for MVP)

## Hard constraints
- NEVER fabricate deadlines, meeting times, or links. If the research agent
  can't find something on a club's site, it must explicitly say so and return
  null/"not found" rather than guessing.
- Nothing gets added to the user's Google Calendar without an explicit
  confirmation step in the UI first.
- Keep API keys in .env, referenced via environment variables. Never hardcode
  or print keys.
- Prefer small, testable functions over large end-to-end scripts. After
  writing any pipeline stage, write or run a quick test against real sample
  data before moving to the next stage.

## Current status
Step 0 (skeleton), Step 1 (scraper), and Step 2 (embeddings + matching) done.
scraper/scrape_campusgroups.py scrapes Cornell's CampusGroups directory by
iterating its ~11 group_type buckets with view=all (the unfiltered listing
silently truncates past ~1100 rows, so per-bucket fetching is what's
reliable — see the module docstring). data/clubs.json has all 1521 real
clubs: name, category, description, website_url. 100% have website_url,
~90% (1366) have a description. The one-off "Cornell CG TEST" bucket is
excluded on purpose.

backend/services/matching.py embeds each club (name + description +
category) with the local sentence-transformers model all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (no
API key needed) and caches vectors to data/embeddings.npy, with a
data/embeddings_meta.json sidecar (hash of source texts + model name) that
auto-invalidates the cache if clubs.json or the model changes. Both files
are gitignored/derived, regenerated on first run (~5s locally). match_clubs
(query, top_k=10) returns clubs ranked by cosine similarity. Sanity-checked
against "sustainability and climate policy clubs, low time commitment" —
top result was GreenClub, all top 5 genuinely on-topic.
Added sentence-transformers to requirements.txt.

Other service files under backend/services/ are still docstring-only stubs.
frontend/ is a placeholder (Node not installed yet — `brew install node`
before Step 6).
Next: Step 3, resume parsing (backend/services/resume_parser.py).
